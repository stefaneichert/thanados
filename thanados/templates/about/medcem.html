            <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 2em"><b>Medieval Cemeteries at the
                Periphery of the Carolingian World (MEDCEM) </b> is one of the thematically focused projects whose data
                is accessible through the THANADOS interface. Specifically, it focuses on the currently widely discussed
                and promising topic of societies on the eastern periphery of the Frankish Empire. Grave finds in the
                context of West Slavic populations are a key source for addressing related issues. MEDCEM is therefore
                progressively collecting the available information and publishing it as digital data in a form
                corresponding to current best practice. All information of the presented sites comes from the original
                publications and is represented as digital catalog along with interactive maps and visualisations of the
                cemeteries. Regionally, the project focuses on the Czech Republic and Austria, but gradually it is
                desirable to involve all regions of the eastern part of Central Europe. If you are interested in
                collaborating on data production or in publishing your own dataset, please contact the project team (see
                contact details below).</p>
            <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 2em">MEDCEM was first developed by
                Stefan Eichert within the Project "International exchange of methodological experience in the study on
                the impact of emergencies on the migration and economic strategies of the past human populations"
                (Project No.: CZ.02.2.69/0.0/0.0/16_027/0008494), funded by the European Union and the Ministry of
                Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic. The published data are the result of the work of
                several generations of researchers, processed into digital form by a number of editors.</p>

            <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 2em">The data available in the MEDCEM is
