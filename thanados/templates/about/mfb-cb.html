               Central Bohemia (MFC-CB)</b> is dedicated to collecting, harmonizing, and publishing data on inhumation
               cemeteries in Central Bohemia from the 9th to the 11th century through the THANADOS interface.
            </p>
            <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 2em">Before the mid-9th century,
               the population of Central Bohemia practised a specific, likely cremation burial rite, which left
               no archaeological traces. The emergence of field cemeteries signifies a profound social transformation
               within the population of Central Bohemia during the formation of the early Premyslid state. The decline
               and gradual abandonment of these burial sites are intimately linked to another significant social process
               — the Christianization of Bohemian societies during the 10th century, primarily in the first half of the
               11th century.

            <h3 id="project">The project</h3>
            <p class="lead text-muted" style="margin-top: 0.3em; margin-bottom: 2em">MFC-CB is a thematically focused
               project that provides accessible data through the THANADOS interface. It specifically concentrates on
               one of the most prominent subjects in early medieval Archaeology in Central Europe, which is the study
               of flat (inhumation) cemeteries that appeared in various regions from late antiquity to the beginning of
               the high medieval transformation. All information regarding the presented sites is derived from original
               publications or proprietary datasets, and it is presented as a digital catalogue featuring interactive maps
               and visualizations of the cemeteries. The project primarily focuses on the region of Central Bohemia. If
               you are interested in collaborating on data production or publishing your own dataset pertaining to other
               regions of the Czech Republic, please contact the project team (contact details provided below).
